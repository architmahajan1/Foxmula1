3. Write an inheritance hierarchy for classes Quadrilateral, Trapezoid, Parallelogram, Rectangle and Square.
Use Quadrilateral as the super class of the hierarchy. The instance variables of Quadrilateral should be
the x-y coordinate pairs for the four endpoints of the Quadrilateral. Write a program that instantiates
objects of your classes and outputs each object's area (except Quadrilateral).
